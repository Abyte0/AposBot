This code has been made by Storm and maybe some others and made public on the forum.

I'm dropping this code here to allow people to easyly checkout and run it from eclipse.

Eclipse configuration will be included with tutorial on how to set it up.

I wasn't in the DevTeam so the first commit will be the Original code from Storm.
Following commits will be comments on the code to understand it.

I MAY add some feature or refartor in the futur commits but we'll see later...
